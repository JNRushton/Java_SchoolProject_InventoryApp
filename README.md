# Java_SchoolProject_InventoryApp

This is a final Java project I created in NetBeans for one of my classes while I was pursuing my BS degree at WGU. 

This basic inventory app keeps track of parts on the left side and products on the right side. It includes the ID, Name, Inventory Level, and Price for each part and product. There is also an add, modify, delete, and search function.
